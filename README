*Installation Notes and Requirements:*

To use the 'cudaBayesreg' package on your system you need the following
installed:
   1. CUDA-capable GPU
   2. CUDA software, which includes the 'nvcc' (release >= 3.1)
      NVIDIA Cuda Compiler driver (available at no cost from
      http://www.nvidia.com/cuda)

*Notes*:
   1. A general purpose C compiler is needed by nvcc. On Linux
      platforms, the compiler is assumed to be ‘gcc’ , or ‘g++’ for
      linking; nvcc releases before version 3.1, are not fully compatible
      with current versions of gcc/g++ 
   2. It is highly recommended that you test the CUDA installation,
      by running the examples in the SDK toolkit (>= 3.1), before using
      'cudaBayesreg'.
   2. The package's host C++ code uses the shared version of the newmat
      matrix library (http://www.robertnz.net/cpp_site.html). The
      Makefile builds 'libnewmat.so', and installs it in src/newmat11.
   3. In 'cudaMultireg.cu' three constants control the amount of CUDA
      allocated space: REGDIM=4096, OBSDIM=128, and XLIM=5. These
      constants define the maximum number of parallel regressions, the
      maximum length of voxel time-series, and the maximum number of
      regression variables, respectively. If these values do not suit
      your needs modify the values, and recompile the code.
